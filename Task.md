# Tasks specifications

Since the homework will be deployed by the Taskium system automatically, so specifying the proper url for the homework is quite important. Since everyone can access the public folder freely, so the homeworks are all put in the public folder. Each taks corresponds to a folder named after the id of the task. Then each student has a folder named after his/her student ID in the task folder. Then each of the homework related to the task will be put in the individual folder of the student. For example, student `09388327` wants to handle the homework `task1` for the first task, which means the task is of ID 1. Then the homework `taks1` will be put in the url:

    http://www.taskium.com/1/09388327/task1
